### Create a Server

Create an Express server by installing and requiring the express package in your project. You can use the following code to create a basic server:

### Create a endpoint

Create an endpoint to create a text file in a particular folder. You can use the fs module to create and write to a file, and the path module to specify the file path. Here's an example of how you can create the endpoint:

###

In this example, the endpoint listens to a POST request to the /create-file URL. It creates a folder called text-files in the current directory if it doesn't already exist. It then generates a filename based on the current date and time, and creates a file with that name in the text-files folder. The file content is set to the current timestamp. The endpoint returns a 200 response if the file is created successfully, or a 500 response if there's an error.

Create an endpoint to retrieve all the text files in the particular folder. You can use the fs module to read the contents of the folder and filter for .txt files. Here's an example of how you can create the endpoint:

In this modified example, the endpoint reads the contents of each text file in the text-files folder and stores the contents in an array along with the file name. It then returns the array of text file contents as a JSON response.

The createReadStream method creates a readable stream to the file, which can be used to read the contents of the file in chunks. The data event is emitted when a chunk of data is available, and the end event is emitted when there is no more data to be read. You can listen for these events and concatenate the chunks of data to get the complete contents of the file.

Note that the readFile method can also be used to read the contents of a file, but it reads the entire file into memory at once, which can be a problem if you're dealing with large files. The createReadStream method is more efficient for reading large files because it reads the file in chunks.
